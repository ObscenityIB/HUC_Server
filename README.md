Homebrew Update Checker - Server


### OwO what's this?
It's one half of a 2 part system to keep your 3DS homebrew up-to-date.
As of **Alpha v0.0.1.0** it just tells you the available newest release files of a supplied repo.
Eventually it will update local copies of homebrew repos to the latest remote release.


This part of the system is known as the **Server**, it keeps your files on your PC up-to-date.
The second half, coming later, will be known as the **Client**, it keeps track of the release versions installed on your 3DS.


The final goal is for the **Client** and **Server** to echange information and stay up-to-date on both ends,
preventing wasted time doing so manually.
